## Description

This project allows the user to quickly write notes on demand.

- Motivation: Motivation was to allow a user to keep track of their notes quickly and easily.
- Problems: I faced problems with getting my routes correctly lined up so they would run properly.
- Solve: Is a good app to write down notes on a phone as compared to a notepad.
- Learn: I learned how to use express better.
- Stand Out: This project stands out because of its simplicity and ease of use.
